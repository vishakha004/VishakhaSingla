## Hello! 

🎓 I'm Vishakha Singla, an MSc Economics student at the London School of Economics. I completed my BA Economics (Hons) from St. Stephen's College.

📚 My research interests include development economics, economics of education and gender economics. 

✨ When I'm not buried in econ books, I love making art, swimming and digging into a Jane Austen novel!
